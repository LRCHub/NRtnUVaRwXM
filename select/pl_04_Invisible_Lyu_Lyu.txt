Another day of painted walls and
football on the TV
No one sees me
Fade away,lost inside a memory
of someone's life
It wasn't mine
I was already missing,before the
night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of
my regrets
Who am I? Who am I?
And l don't know myself
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible
Wasted days dreaming of the time
I know I can't get back
Seems I just lost track
Looking on as all of life's
colors seem to fade to grey
I just walked away
I was already missing,before the
night I left
Just me and your shadow and all
of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I?
And l don't know myself
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible ×3
Another day,the walls are built
to keep me Safe
I can't escape,it's too late
