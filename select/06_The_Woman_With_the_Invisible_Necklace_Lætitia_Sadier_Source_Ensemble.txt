Cease to support the tyrant
He collapses
Our thoughts aren't real
Our product
All means of communication
An indoctrination

Concrete freedom
When everyone
Can satisfy their needs

(We remain)
(We remain)
(We remain)
We remain situational
Totalianarism

Further away from the revolutionary concern

We respond to the call
Buy some more
One size fits all

Both the ruling class
Situational
Made to aspire
To the perpetuation
Of the domination

The slave is consenting to his own trap
Our revolution will want the poor
We are all bourgeois now
