ANOTHER DAY OF PAINTED WALLS
AND FOOTBALL ON THE TV
NO ONE SEES ME
FADE AWAY, LOST INSIDE A MEMORY
OF SOMEONE'S LIFE
IT WASN'T MINE
I WAS ALREADY MISSING, BEFORE THE NIGHT I LEFT
JUST ME AND MY SHADOW
AND ALL OF MY REGRETS
WHO AM I? WHO AM I?
AND I DON'T KNOW MYSELF
WHO AM I? WHO AM I?
INVISIBLE
WASTED DAYS DREAMING OF THE TIMES
I KNOW I CAN'T GET BACK
SEEMS I JUST LOST TRACK
LOOKING ON AS ALL OF LIFE'S COLORS
SEEM TO FADE TO GREY
I JUST WALKED AWAY
I WAS ALREADY MISSING, BEFORE THE NIGHT I LEFT
JUST ME AND YOUR SHADOW
AND ALL OF MY REGRETS
WHO AM I? WHO AM I?
AND I DON'T KNOW MYSELF
WHO AM I? WHO AM I?
INVISIBLE
(X3)
ANOTHER DAY, THE WALLS ARE BUILT TO KEEP ME SAFE
I CAN'T ESCAPE, IT'S TOO LATE
