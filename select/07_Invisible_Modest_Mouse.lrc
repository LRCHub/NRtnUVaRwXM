[00:34.71] Oh, well lesson dance
[00:36.66] And shoot to God
[00:37.71] A storm-suffered owl
[00:39.48] You're not invisible inside your car
[00:57.48] 
[00:42.06] No matter what stupid sort of mission you're on
[00:46.08] Well, you're not invisible inside your car
[00:56.34] I go absolutely mental
[00:59.39] Good ramblin' George
[01:09.39] 
[01:01.02] Well, you're not invisible inside your car
[01:04.45] No matter, you could breathe it like your flies in a jar
[01:07.67] Yeah, you're not invisible
[01:11.42] I like the saline tea
[01:21.92] 
[01:14.65] Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
[01:19.56] I should just let it be
[01:22.13] Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
[01:27.29] (And it's sad)
[01:34.29] 
[01:29.54] Oh, we had to have some time
[01:31.59] Gonna shake like a charm
[01:33.63] Well, you weren't invisible
[01:35.55] Not all along
[01:42.05] 
[01:37.49] No matter how many eons came and are gone
[01:40.95] We were not invisible
[01:44.23] I knew that
[01:49.73] 
[01:45.54] I like the saline tea
[01:48.08] Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
[01:52.56] And there's the orphan sea
[01:55.06] We were never invisible, but that I guess we did not see
[02:23.06] 
[02:13.48] Of course this all had been laid down
[02:17.92] Way before we lay down for it all
[02:21.51] Before we had a course, of course
[02:25.11] Of course this all had been laid down
[02:29.04] Of course we lay down
[02:31.86] Of course we lay down
[02:36.03] Of course we lay down
[02:39.42] Of course we lay down
[02:43.54] Of course we lay down
[02:47.32] Of course we lay down
[03:04.47] I like the saline tea
[03:07.43] Well, it's true that the moon could pull it back and far away from me
[03:12.13] I like the orphan sea
[03:15.13] Well, we were never invisible, but that I guess we could not see
[03:32.98] We'll get crushed by the ocean
[03:35.35] But it will not get us wet
[03:37.10] Crushed by the ocean
[03:39.34] But it will not get us wet
[03:41.40] Crushed by the ocean
[03:42.87] But it will not get us wet
[03:44.98] Crushed by the ocean
[03:46.49] But it will not get us wet
